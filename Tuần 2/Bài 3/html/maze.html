                            Welcome to the Sunny Acres Corn Maze. We first heard about mazes from agricultural exchange students who
                            came from England in 1985. In Eupore, mazes are very popular in castle gardens. After hearing about the 
                            mazes in Eupore, we throught it would be a great idea to build one of our own right outside of Council Bluffs.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Since 1997, thousands of people have enjoyed our Corn Mazes. We hope that your family gets as much enjoyment
                            out of this year's Corn Mazes as we did building it! Our family would like to invite your family to come out
                            and visit us at this year's Corn Maze and AutumnFest.
